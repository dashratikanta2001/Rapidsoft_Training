## Q1---
## Write a class called "Calculator" with overloaded methods to perform addition. Implement methods for adding two integers, adding three integers, and adding two doubles. Test the methods with different inputs.

## Q2---
## Create a class called "Rectangle" with overloaded methods to calculate the area. Implement methods to calculate the area when the length and width are provided, and when only the length is provided (assuming it's a square). Test the methods with different values.

## Q3---
## Write a class called "ArrayOperations" with overloaded methods to find the maximum element in an array. Implement methods for finding the maximum element in an array of integers, an array of doubles, and an array of strings. Test the methods with different arrays.
        Hints-- int[] numbers = { 5, 8, 2, 11, 4 };
                double[] doubles = { 3.5, 9.2, 1.7, 6.8 };
                String[] strings = { "apple", "banana", "cherry", "pear" }       
## Q4:-
## Create a base class called "Animal" with a method called "makeSound()". Create a derived class called "Cat" that inherits from "Animal" and overrides the "makeSound()" method to make the sound "Meow". Test the overridden method by creating an instance of "Cat" and calling the "makeSound()" method.

## Q5:-
## Create a base class called "Shape" with a method called "calculateArea()". The method should return the area of the shape as a double value. Then, create three derived classes: "Rectangle", "Circle", and "Triangle". Each derived class should inherit from the "Shape" class and override the "calculateArea()" method to provide the area calculation specific to that shape. Test the overridden methods by creating instances of each inherited class and calling the "calculateArea()" method.                

## Q-6
## Create a class called "Calculator" with a method called "sumNumbers". The method should take a variable number of integers as arguments using the varargs parameter. The method should calculate and return the sum of all the integers provided as arguments. Test the "sumNumbers" method by creating an instance of the "Calculator" class and calling the method with different numbers of arguments.
