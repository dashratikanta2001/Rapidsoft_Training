## 1) Inheritance:
### a) Create a class called "Animal" with a method "sound()". Create two subclasses, "Cat" and "Dog", that inherit from the "Animal" class and override the "sound()" method to make different sounds for each subclass.

## 2) Conversion and Casting:
### a) Write a program that prompts the user to enter a double value. Convert the double to an int and display the result.
### b) Create a class called "Vehicle" with a method "startEngine()". Create another class called "Car" that extends "Vehicle" and overrides the "startEngine()" method to display "Car engine started." Implement a program to demonstrate upcasting and call the "startEngine()" method on both a "Vehicle" object and a "Car" object.

## 3) Method Overriding:
### a) Create a class called "Shape" with a method "calculateArea()". Create two subclasses, "Rectangle" and "Circle", that inherit from the "Shape" class and override the "calculateArea()" method to calculate the area of a rectangle and circle, respectively. Implement a program to demonstrate method overriding by calling the "calculateArea()" method on objects of both subclasses.

## 4) Covariant Returns:
### a) Create a class called "Person" with a method "getDetails()" that returns a "Person" object. Create a subclass called "Student" that extends "Person" and overrides the "getDetails()" method to return a "Student" object. Implement a program to demonstrate covariant returns by calling the "getDetails()" method on both a "Person" object and a "Student" object.

## 5) "super" Keyword:
### a) Create a class called "Vehicle" with a constructor that accepts a String parameter representing the vehicle's brand. Create a subclass called "Car" that extends "Vehicle" and has a constructor that calls the superclass constructor using the "super" keyword. Implement a program to demonstrate the use of the "super" keyword by creating a "Car" object and displaying its brand.

## 6) Final Keyword:
### a) Create a final class called "MathUtils" with a method "addNumbers(int a, int b)" that adds two numbers and returns the result. Implement a program to demonstrate the use of a final class by calling the "addNumbers()" method.
### b) Create a class called "Circle" with a final method "calculateArea()" that calculates and returns the area of a circle. Create a subclass called "Cylinder" that extends "Circle" and tries to override the "calculateArea()" method. Implement a program to demonstrate the use of a final method and explain the resulting behavior.
