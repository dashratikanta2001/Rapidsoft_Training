## 1. Create a Vehicle class as the base class with attributes like make, model, and year. Implement subclasses such as Car, Motorcycle, and Truck that inherit from Vehicle.  Override methods like calculateRentalCost() in each subclass based on specific rental rules. Use dynamic method dispatch to call the appropriate method based on the type of vehicle.
   
## 2. Create a program for calculates the area and perimeter of different shapes. Create a Shape superclass with methods like calculateArea() and calculatePerimeter(). Implement subclasses like  Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle that override these methods with shape-specific calculations. Use covariant return types to provide appropriate return types for the overridden methods.

## 3. Create a program for an online bookstore that sells different types of books. Design a Book superclass with attributes like title, author, and price. Implement subclasses such as  FictionBook, NonFictionBook, and Ebook that inherit from Book. Override methods like getDiscountedPrice() in each subclass based on specific discount rules. Use inheritance to share common attributes and behaviors.

## 4. Create a program for bank account management system that handles different types of accounts. Create a BankAccount superclass with attributes like accountNumber, balance, and methods like withdraw() and deposit().  Implement subclasses such as SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount that inherit from BankAccount and override methods as needed. Use the super keyword to invoke superclass methods when necessary.

## 5. Create a program for student management system that stores information about students. Create a Person superclass with attributes like name and age.  Implement a Student subclass that inherits from Person and adds attributes like studentId , class and section. Override methods like displayInfo() in the Student subclass to provide specific information.  Use conversion and casting to manipulate objects of different types in the system.
